Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses the `gspread` library to interact with the Google Slides API and fetches the content of the slides.\n2. The code logic is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue in the error handling. Currently, if an exception occurs while parsing the slides, the function will print an error message and return an empty dictionary. This could be problematic if the calling code expects the returned dictionary to contain the parsed content of the slides. A better approach would be to raise the exception and let the calling code decide how to handle it.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `GoogleSlidesParser` class has a `parse_slides` method that takes a slide ID as input and returns a dictionary containing the parsed content of the slides.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `GoogleSlidesParser` class has a constructor and a `parse_slides` method.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `gspread` library is imported for interacting with the Google Slides API, and the `typing` module is imported for type hinting.\n6. There are no methods from other files being reused in this file.\n\n## Actions\n1. Modify the error handling in the `parse_slides` method to raise the exception instead of returning an empty dictionary. This will allow the calling code to decide how to handle the error.\n   ```python\n   def parse_slides(self, slide_id: str) -> Dict:\n       """\n       This function fetches the Google Slides content using the Google Slides API and parses it into a dictionary.\n\n       Args:\n           slide_id (str): The ID of the Google Slides to be parsed.\n\n       Returns:\n           dict: The parsed content of the Google Slides.\n       """\n       try:\n           slide = self.gspread.open_by_key(slide_id)\n           parsed_content = {}\n\n           for i, slide in enumerate(slide.slides):\n               elements = slide.get_all_elements()\n               parsed_content[i] = [element.text for element in elements]\n\n           return parsed_content\n\n       except Exception as e:\n           print(f"An error occurred while parsing the slides: {e}")\n           raise e\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses the `gspread` library to interact with the Google Slides API and fetches the content of the slides.\n2. The code logic is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue. The variable `slide` is used twice with different meanings, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs. The first usage is for the entire presentation, and the second usage is for individual slides within the presentation.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `GoogleSlidesParser` class has been implemented with the `parse_slides` method as described in the class diagram.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `parse_slides` method is implemented and it fetches and parses the Google Slides content.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `gspread` library is imported for interacting with the Google Slides API, and the `typing` module is imported for type hinting.\n6. As this is the first file under review, there are no methods from other files being reused in this file.\n\n## Actions\n1. Rename the second usage of the `slide` variable to avoid confusion. For example, the individual slides could be referred to as `individual_slide` or `current_slide`.\n   ```python\n   for i, individual_slide in enumerate(slide.slides):\n       elements = individual_slide.get_all_elements()\n       parsed_content[i] = [element.text for element in elements]\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite google_slides_parser.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## google_slides_parser.py\n...\n```\n'}]

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It contains a `NotionConverter` class that uses the `notion` library to convert parsed Google Slides content into a Notion-compatible format and create a new Notion page with the converted content.\n2. The code logic is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue. The `NotionConverter` class assumes that the `NotionClient` object will always be successfully created with the provided `token_v2`. However, if the `token_v2` is invalid or expired, the `NotionClient` object creation will fail and throw an exception. This should be handled in a `try/except` block.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `NotionConverter` class has a `convert_to_notion` method that takes a dictionary of parsed content and returns a string.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `NotionConverter` class has a `convert_to_notion` method that converts the parsed Google Slides content into a Notion-compatible format and creates a new Notion page with the converted content.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `notion.client` and `typing` modules are imported at the beginning of the file.\n6. Yes, methods from other files are being reused correctly. The `NotionConverter` class uses the `NotionClient` class from the `notion.client` module to interact with the Notion API.\n\n## Actions\n1. Add a `try/except` block around the `NotionClient` object creation to handle potential exceptions.\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self, token_v2: str):\n       """\n       Initialize the NotionConverter with a Notion token.\n\n       Args:\n           token_v2 (str): The token_v2 of the Notion account.\n       """\n       try:\n           self.notion = NotionClient(token_v2=token_v2)\n       except Exception as e:\n           print(f"An error occurred while creating the NotionClient object: {e}")\n           raise e\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite notion_converter.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## notion_converter.py\n...\n```\n'}]

The methods in the TaskManager class are correctly creating, assigning, and tracking tasks.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The TaskManager, Task, and User classes are implemented as per the class diagram.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The TaskManager class has the createTask, assignTask, and trackTask methods. The Task and User classes have methods to set their properties.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The TaskScheduler library is imported at the top of the file.\n6. Yes, methods from other files are being reused correctly. The Task and User classes are used in the TaskManager class to create and assign tasks.\n\n## Actions\n1.

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. The TaskManager class is responsible for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks, which is what the code does.\n2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It checks for null arguments and throws an exception if any are found, which is a good practice for error handling.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The TaskManager class has a list of tasks and methods for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks.\n4. No, all functions are not implemented. The `Assign` and `GetStatus` methods are called on the `Task` object, but these methods are not defined in the `Task` class. To fix this, we need to implement these methods in the `Task` class.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `System` and `System.Collections.Generic` namespaces are imported, which are necessary for the `List<T>` class and `ArgumentNullException` class.\n6. Yes, methods from other files are being reused correctly. The `Task` and `User` classes are used in the `TaskManager` class.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the `Assign` method in the `Task` class. This method should take a `User` object as an argument and assign it to the `assignee` field of the `Task` object.\n   ```csharp\n   public void Assign(User user)\n   {\n       if (user == null)\n       {\n           throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(user));\n       }\n\n       this.assignee = user;\n   }\n   ```\n2. Implement the `GetStatus` method in the `Task` class. This method should return the status of the task. For simplicity, let\'s assume that the task status is `Completed` if the current date is after the deadline, and `InProgress` otherwise.\n   ```csharp\n   public TaskStatus GetStatus()\n   {\n       if (DateTime.Now > this.deadline)\n       {\n           return TaskStatus.Completed;\n       }\n       else\n       {\n           return TaskStatus.InProgress;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite TaskManager.cs with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## TaskManager.cs\n...\n```\n'}]

The code is partially implemented as per the requirements. The methods `SubmitCode` and `ReviewCode` are not fully implemented. They should be integrated with GitHub API using Octokit for code submission and SharpDiff for diff generation respectively.\n2. The code logic is correct as far as it has been implemented. There are no errors in the existing code.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `CodeReview` class has a list of `Code` objects and methods to submit and review code.\n4. All functions are not implemented. The integration with GitHub API using Octokit for code submission in `SubmitCode` method and integration with SharpDiff for diff generation in `ReviewCode` method are not implemented.\n5. The necessary pre-dependencies `System`, `System.Collections.Generic`, `SharpDiff`, and `Octokit` have been imported. However, the actual usage of `SharpDiff` and `Octokit` is not implemented.\n6. There are no methods from other files being reused in this file.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the `SubmitCode` method to integrate with GitHub API using Octokit for code submission. Here is a basic example of how to create a new repository using Octokit:\n   ```csharp\n   var newRepository = new NewRepository("Hello-World");\n   var repository = await client.Repository.Create(newRepository);\n   ```\n   You can modify this code to submit code to an existing repository.\n2. Implement the `ReviewCode` method to integrate with SharpDiff for diff generation. Here is a basic example of how to generate a diff using SharpDiff:\n   ```csharp\n   var diff = SharpDiff.Compare("Hello, World!", "Hello, GitHub!");\n   foreach (var line in diff.Lines)\n   {\n       Console.WriteLine(line);\n   }\n   ```\n   You can modify this code to generate a diff between the submitted code and the existing code in the repository.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite CodeReview.cs with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## CodeReview.cs\n...\n```\n'}]

CodeReview.cs\n1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses the SharpDiff library for diff generation and Octokit for GitHub API interaction.\n2. No, the code logic is not completely correct. The `ReviewCode` method is supposed to generate a diff between the existing code and the new code. However, it is currently comparing the new code with the first code submitted by the same user. This might not always be the correct code to compare with. Instead, it should compare with the most recent code submitted by the user.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". It has a `SubmitCode` method for code submission and a `ReviewCode` method for code review.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `SubmitCode` method submits the code to GitHub and the `ReviewCode` method generates a diff for code review.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The SharpDiff and Octokit libraries are used for diff generation and GitHub API interaction respectively.\n6. Yes, methods from other files are being reused correctly. The `GetName` method from the `User` class and the `GetContent` and `GetSubmitter` methods from the `Code` class are being used.\n\n## Actions\n1. Modify the `ReviewCode` method to compare the new code with the most recent code submitted by the user. This can be achieved by changing the `Find` method to `FindLast`.\n   ```csharp\n   public void ReviewCode(Code code, User user)\n   {\n       if (code == null)\n       {\n           throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(code));\n       }\n\n       if (user == null)\n       {\n           throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(user));\n       }\n\n       // Integrate with SharpDiff for diff generation\n       var existingCode = this.codes.FindLast(c => c.GetSubmitter().GetName() == user.GetName());\n       if (existingCode != null)\n       {\n           var diff = SharpDiff.Compare(existingCode.GetContent(), code.GetContent());\n           foreach (var line in diff.Lines)\n           {\n               Console.WriteLine(line);\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite CodeReview.cs with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## CodeReview.cs\n...\n```\n'}]

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It has a user interface for task management, code review, and notification system.\n2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It provides a user interface for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks, submitting and reviewing code, and sending notifications.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". It uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for building the user interface, which is as per the system design.\n4. No, the functions for the button click events (OnCreateTask, OnAssignTask, OnTrackTask, OnSubmitCode, OnReviewCode, OnSendNotification) are not implemented. These functions need to be implemented in the code-behind file (MainWindow.xaml.cs) to handle the button click events.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The XAML code has the necessary namespaces for WPF.\n6. Not applicable as this is a XAML file and does not reuse methods from other files.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the button click event handlers in the MainWindow.xaml.cs file. For example, the OnCreateTask function can be implemented as follows:\n```csharp\nprivate void OnCreateTask(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    // Code to create a task\n}\n```\nSimilarly, implement the other event handlers (OnAssignTask, OnTrackTask, OnSubmitCode, OnReviewCode, OnSendNotification).\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite MainWindow.xaml with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## MainWindow.xaml\n...\n```\n'}]

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It provides a user interface for task management, code review, and notifications.\n2. Yes, the code logic is correct. It provides the necessary UI elements and event handlers for the application.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". It uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for building the UI as specified in the system design.\n4. No, the event handlers for the button clicks (OnCreateTask, OnAssignTask, OnTrackTask, OnSubmitCode, OnReviewCode, OnSendNotification) are not implemented. These should be implemented in the code-behind file (MainWindow.xaml.cs) to handle the respective actions.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The necessary namespaces for WPF are included at the top of the file.\n6. Not applicable as this file does not reuse methods from other files.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the event handlers for the button clicks in the MainWindow.xaml.cs file. For example, the OnCreateTask event handler could look like this:\n   ```csharp\n   private void OnCreateTask(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n   {\n       // Code to create a task\n   }\n   ```\n   Similarly, implement the other event handlers (OnAssignTask, OnTrackTask, OnSubmitCode, OnReviewCode, OnSendNotification).\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite MainWindow.xaml with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## MainWindow.xaml\n...\n```\n'}]

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. The `Converter` class uses `GoogleSlidesAPI` and `NotionAPI` to convert a Google Slide to a Notion page.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - The code logic seems correct, but the actual implementation of the `get_slide` method in `GoogleSlidesAPI` and `create_page` method in `NotionAPI` is missing. These methods need to be implemented to make the `convert` method in `Converter` class functional.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `Converter` class has `GoogleSlidesAPI` and `NotionAPI` objects and a `convert` method. The `GoogleSlidesAPI` and `NotionAPI` classes have the required methods as per the interfaces.\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - No, the `get_slide` method in `GoogleSlidesAPI` and `create_page` method in `NotionAPI` are not implemented. They need to be implemented to interact with the respective APIs and perform the required operations.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `requests` library is imported which will be used to make HTTP requests to the APIs.\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - As per the provided code, there are no methods from other files being reused.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the `get_slide` method in `GoogleSlidesAPI` to interact with the Google Slides API and get the slide data.\n   ```python\n   def get_slide(self, slide_id: str) -> Dict:\n       # Implement the logic to get slide data from Google Slides API\n       # Use the requests library to make HTTP requests to the API\n   ```\n2. Implement the `create_page` method in `NotionAPI` to create a page in Notion using the provided data.\n   ```python\n   def create_page(self, data: Dict) -> str:\n       # Implement the logic to create a page in Notion using the provided data\n       # Use the requests library to make HTTP requests to the API\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

The GoogleSlidesAPI class has the get_slide method, the NotionAPI class has the create_page method, and the Converter class has the convert method.\n2. The code logic seems correct, but it lacks error handling. For instance, the HTTP requests to the Google Slides API and Notion API might fail, or the APIs might return an error response. These cases should be handled properly.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The Converter class has GoogleSlidesAPI and NotionAPI objects and a convert function, as specified in the class diagram.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The GoogleSlidesAPI class has the get_slide function, the NotionAPI class has the create_page function, and the Converter class has the convert function.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The requests library, which is used for making HTTP requests to the APIs, is imported at the beginning of the file.\n6. The methods from other files are not being used in this file, so this question is not applicable.\n\n## Actions\n1. Add error handling to the get_slide and create_page methods. For instance, check the status code of the HTTP response and raise an exception if it\'s not 200. Also, check if the \'id\' key is in the response JSON when creating a page in Notion.\n   ```python\n   class GoogleSlidesAPI:\n       def get_slide(self, slide_id: str) -> Dict:\n           response = requests.get(f"https://slides.googleapis.com/v1/presentations/{slide_id}")\n           if response.status_code != 200:\n               raise Exception(f"Failed to get slide: {response.text}")\n           slide_data = response.json()\n           return slide_data\n\n   class NotionAPI:\n       def create_page(self, data: Dict) -> str:\n           response = requests.post("https://api.notion.com/v1/pages", json=data)\n           if response.status_code != 200:\n               raise Exception(f"Failed to create page: {response.text}")\n           page_id = response.json().get("id")\n           if not page_id:\n               raise Exception("Failed to get page ID from Notion API response")\n           return page_id\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite converter.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## converter.py\n...\n```\n'}]

The code is implemented as per the requirements. However, the actual logic for code optimization is not implemented. The methods `_remove_unnecessary_spaces`, `_simplify_expressions`, and `_inline_functions` are placeholders and need to be implemented.\n2. The code logic is correct, but it\'s incomplete. The methods `_remove_unnecessary_spaces`, `_simplify_expressions`, and `_inline_functions` need to be implemented.\n3. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `CodeOptimizer` class has the `optimize_code` method as specified.\n4. All functions are not implemented. The methods `_remove_unnecessary_spaces`, `_simplify_expressions`, and `_inline_functions` are placeholders and need to be implemented.\n5. There are no pre-dependencies to be imported in this code.\n6. There are no methods from other files being reused in this code.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the `_remove_unnecessary_spaces` method to remove unnecessary spaces from the code. This can be achieved using Python\'s `str.strip()` method.\n   ```python\n   def _remove_unnecessary_spaces(self, code: str) -> str:\n       return \' \'.join(code.split())\n   ```\n2. Implement the `_simplify_expressions` method to simplify expressions in the code. This can be a complex task depending on the language of the code and the complexity of the expressions. A simple implementation could be to replace common patterns with their simplified versions.\n   ```python\n   def _simplify_expressions(self, code: str) -> str:\n       # This is a placeholder. Replace with actual implementation.\n       return code\n   ```\n3. Implement the `_inline_functions` method to inline functions in the code. This can be a complex task depending on the language of the code and the complexity of the functions. A simple implementation could be to replace function calls with the function\'s code.\n   ```python\n   def _inline_functions(self, code: str) -> str:\n       # This is a placeholder.

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. The `CodeHardener` class has been defined with the `harden_code` method as specified.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - No, the code logic is not completely correct. The methods `_add_error_handling` and `_improve_security` are placeholders and do not contain any implementation. These methods need to be implemented to harden the code.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `CodeHardener` class and its methods are defined as per the class diagram.\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - No, the functions `_add_error_handling` and `_improve_security` are not implemented. These functions need to be implemented to add error handling and improve security of the code respectively.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - As per the given code, there are no pre-dependencies that need to be imported.\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - As per the given code, there are no methods from other files being reused.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the `_add_error_handling` method to add error handling to the code. This could involve adding try-except blocks around function calls and checking for null values before accessing variables.\n   ```python\n   def _add_error_handling(self, code: str) -> str:\n       # Add error handling to the code\n       # This is a placeholder. Replace with actual implementation.\n       # For example, we can add try-except blocks around function calls\n       # and check for null values before accessing variables\n       return code\n   ```\n2. Implement the `_improve_security` method to improve the security of the code. This could involve sanitizing inputs to prevent SQL injection and using secure functions for handling sensitive data.\n   ```python\n   def _improve_security(self, code: str) -> str:\n       # Improve the security of the code\n       # This is a placeholder. Replace with actual implementation.\n       # For example, we can sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection\n       # and use secure functions for handling sensitive data\n       return code\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It has a `NotificationManager` class with a `notify_user` method that sends an email notification to the user.\n2. No, the code logic is not completely correct. The `ssl` module is used in the `notify_user` method but it is not imported. This will cause a `NameError` when the `ssl.create_default_context()` function is called. To fix this, we need to import the `ssl` module at the beginning of the file.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `NotificationManager` class has the necessary attributes and methods as per the class diagram.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `notify_user` method is implemented in the `NotificationManager` class.\n5. No, the `ssl` module is not imported. We need to import it at the beginning of the file to use the `ssl.create_default_context()` function in the `notify_user` method.\n6. Yes, methods from other files are not used in this file.\n\n## Actions\n1. Import the `ssl` module at the beginning of the file.\n   ```python\n   import smtplib\n   import ssl\n   from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n   from email.mime.text import MIMEText\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

C:\\Users\\iZac\\Documents\\slide-to-notion\\workspace\\EXAMPLE DECK if we get ahead of schedule and finish the 1:1 notion converter. because we need that before we need this wizard but id love both eventually. lets try to wrap this up but maintain quality and goals, just be you know optimal in our actions and think about that overall. Are we wasting credits and tokens on something we shouldnt? Is there a way to ensure this OVERALL project is achieved faster and more optimally while not harming accuracy and quality?\n\n### Search Information\n-\n\n\n-----\n\n## format example\n[CONTENT]\n{\n    "Language": "en_us",\n    "Programming Language": "Python",\n    "Original Requirements": "Create a 2048 game",\n    "Project Name": "game_2048",\n    "Product Goals": [\n        "Create an engaging user experience",\n        "Improve accessibility, be responsive",\n        "More beautiful UI"\n    ],\n    "User Stories": [\n        "As a player, I want to be able to choose difficulty levels",\n        "As a player, I want to see my score after each game",\n        "As a player, I want to get restart button when I lose",\n        "As a player, I want to see beautiful UI that make me feel good",\n        "As a player, I want to play game via mobile phone"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Analysis": [\n        "2048 Game A: Simple interface, lacks responsive features",\n        "play2048.co: Beautiful and responsive UI with my best score shown",\n        "2048game.com: Responsive UI with my best score shown, but many ads"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Quadrant Chart": "quadrantChart\\n    title \\"Reach and engagement of campaigns\\"\\n    x-axis \\"Low Reach\\" --> \\"High Reach\\"\\n    y-axis \\"Low Engagement\\" --> \\"High Engagement\\"\\n    quadrant-1 \\"We should expand\\"\\n    quadrant-2 \\"Need to promote\\"\\n    quadrant-3 \\"Re-evaluate\\"\\n    quadrant-4 \\"May be improved\\"\\n    \\"Campaign A\\": [0.3, 0.6]\\n    \\"Campaign B\\": [0.45, 0.23]\\n    \\"Campaign C\\": [0.57, 0.69]\\n    \\"Campaign D\\": [0.78, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign E\\": [0.40, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign F\\": [0.35, 0.78]\\n    \\"Our Target Product\\": [0.5, 0.6]",\n    "Requirement Analysis": "",\n    "Requirement Pool": [\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The main code ..."\n        ],\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The game algorithm ..."\n        ]\n    ],\n    "UI Design draft": "Basic function description with a simple style and layout.",\n    "Anything UNCLEAR": ""\n}\n[/CONTENT]\n\n## nodes: "<node>: <type>  # <instruction>"\n- Language: <class \'str\'>  # Provide the language used in the project, typically matching the user\'s requirement language.\n- Programming Language: <class \'str\'>  # Python/JavaScript or other mainstream programming language.\n- Original Requirements: <class \'str\'>  # Place the original user\'s requirements here.\n- Project Name: <class \'str\'>  # According to the content of "Original Requirements," name the project using snake case style , like \'game_2048\' or \'simple_crm.\n- Product Goals: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to three clear, orthogonal product goals.\n- User Stories: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to 3 to 5 scenario-based user stories.\n- Competitive Analysis: typing.List[str]  # Provide 5 to 7 competitive products.\n- Competitive Quadrant Chart: <class \'str\'>  # Use mermaid quadrantChart syntax.

Here is a sample code snippet on how to use the `googleapiclient` library to extract text from Google Slides:\n   ```python\n   from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n   from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\n   from google.auth.transport.requests import Request\n\n   # If modifying these SCOPES, delete the file token.pickle.\n   SCOPES = [\'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations.readonly\']\n\n   def get_slide_text(presentation_id):\n       """Shows basic usage of the Slides API.\n       Prints the number of slides and elements in a sample presentation:\n       https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EAYk18WDjIG-zp_0vLm3CsfQh_i8eXc67Jo2O9C6Vuc/edit\n       """\n       creds = None\n       # The file token.pickle stores the user\'s access and refresh tokens, and is\n       # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first\n       # time.\n       if os.path.exists(\'token.pickle\'):\n           with open(\'token.pickle\', \'rb\') as token:\n               creds = pickle.load(token)\n       # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.\n       if not creds or not creds.valid:\n           if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:\n               creds.refresh(Request())\n           else:\n               flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(\n                   \'credentials.json\', SCOPES)\n               creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)\n           # Save the credentials for the next run\n           with open(\'token.pickle\', \'wb\') as token:\n               pickle.dump(creds, token)\n\n       service = build(\'slides\', \'v1\', credentials=creds)\n\n       # Call the Slides API\n       presentation = service.presentations().get(presentationId=presentation_id).execute()\n       slides = presentation.get(\'slides\')\n\n       for i, slide in enumerate(slides):\n           for element in slide.get(\'pageElements\'):\n               if \'shape\' in element:\n                   if \'text\' in element[\'shape\']:\n                       for textElement in element[\'shape\'][\'text\'][\'textElements\']:\n                           if \'textRun\' in textElement:\n                               print(textElement[\'textRun\'][\'content\'])\n   ```\n2. Update the `convert` function to use the `get_slide_text` function to extract text from Google Slides.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It has the EnvironmentManager class with methods to setup and cleanup the environment.\n2. No, the code logic is not completely correct. The cleanup_environment method tries to deactivate the virtual environment and remove the environment directory. However, the \'deactivate\' command will not work in this context as it is a shell command and not a Python command. Also, os.rmdir will only remove empty directories. If the virtual environment has any files or subdirectories, this command will fail.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The EnvironmentManager class has the setup_environment and cleanup_environment methods as described in the interfaces.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The setup_environment and cleanup_environment methods are implemented in the EnvironmentManager class.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The os and venv modules are imported at the beginning of the file.\n6. No, methods from other files are not being used in this file.\n\n## Actions\n1. Modify the cleanup_environment method to correctly remove the virtual environment. We can use the shutil module\'s rmtree function to remove the directory and all its contents. We can remove the \'deactivate\' command as it will not work in this context.\n   ```python\n   import shutil\n\n   def cleanup_environment(self):\n       """\n       Clean up the virtual environment.\n       """\n       # Remove the virtual environment directory\n       shutil.rmtree(self.env_path)\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite environment_manager.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## environment_manager.py\n...\n```\n'}]

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses the FileManager and EnvironmentManager classes to read PowerPoint slides, convert them to Notion pages, and write the result to a file.\n2. No, the code logic is not completely correct. The `_convert_to_notion` method is creating new Notion pages but it\'s not storing any information about these pages in the `notion_data` dictionary which is returned and written to a file. This should be fixed by storing the URL of each new Notion page in the `notion_data` dictionary.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". It correctly uses the FileManager and EnvironmentManager classes and their methods.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `convert` method uses the FileManager and EnvironmentManager to convert PowerPoint slides to Notion pages and the `_convert_to_notion` method contains the logic for this conversion.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `notion.client` and `notion.block` modules from the `notion-py` package are imported for interacting with the Notion API. The FileManager and EnvironmentManager classes are also imported correctly.\n6. Yes, methods from other files are being reused correctly. The `read_file` and `write_file` methods from the FileManager class and the `setup_environment` and `cleanup_environment` methods from the EnvironmentManager class are used correctly in the `convert` method.\n\n## Actions\n1. Fix the `_convert_to_notion` method to store the URL of each new Notion page in the `notion_data` dictionary.\n   ```python\n   def _convert_to_notion(self, slide_data: Dict) -> Dict:\n       """\n       Convert the slide data to Notion data.\n       """\n       notion_data = {}\n       client = NotionClient(token_v2="your_token_here")\n       page = client.get_block("your_page_url_here")\n\n       for i, slide in slide_data.items():\n           new_child = page.children.add_new(TextBlock, title=f"Slide {i+1}")\n           for text in slide:\n               new_child.children.add_new(TextBlock, title=text)\n           notion_data[i] = new_child.get_browseable_url()\n\n       return notion_data\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. It uses the FileManager and EnvironmentManager classes to read PowerPoint slides, convert them to Notion pages, and write the results to a file.\n2. The code logic is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue with the NotionClient token and page URL. These values are hardcoded, which is not a good practice. It would be better to pass these as parameters to the `convert` method or the `Converter` class constructor.\n3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces". The `Converter` class has a `convert` method that takes a slide path and a notion path as parameters, and it uses the `FileManager` and `EnvironmentManager` classes as expected.\n4. Yes, all functions are implemented. The `convert` method sets up the environment, reads the slide data, converts it to Notion data, writes the data to a file, and cleans up the environment. The `_convert_to_notion` method converts the slide data to Notion data.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported. The `FileManager` and `EnvironmentManager` classes are imported from their respective modules, and the `NotionClient` and `TextBlock` classes are imported from the `notion` package.\n6. Yes, methods from the `FileManager` and `EnvironmentManager` classes are being reused correctly in the `Converter` class.\n\n## Actions\n1. Refactor the `Converter` class to accept the NotionClient token and page URL as parameters. This could be done in the `convert` method or the `Converter` class constructor. Here is an example of how to do this in the `convert` method:\n   ```python\n   class Converter:\n       # ...\n       def convert(self, slide_path: str, notion_path: str, token: str, page_url: str) -> str:\n           # ...\n           # Convert the slide data to Notion data\n           notion_data = self._convert_to_notion(slide_data, token, page_url)\n           # ...\n   \n       def _convert_to_notion(self, slide_data: Dict, token: str, page_url: str) -> Dict:\n           # ...\n           client = NotionClient(token_v2=token)\n           page = client.get_block(page_url)\n           # ...\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite converter.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## converter.py\n...\n```\n'}]

Here that PRD from another gpt 🔑 Core Requirements
1. Functional Goals
Convert Google Slides decks → Notion toggles, blocks, and pages.

Maintain 1:1 visual fidelity:

Fonts, sizes, and colors (closest possible match in Notion).

Text alignment (center, left, right, justified).

Lists (bulleted & numbered).

Images and thumbnails (external links, fallback to screenshots if needed).

Preserve deck revision sync:

Detect unchanged decks → skip update.

Detect additions/removals → sync to Notion.

2. Non-Functional Goals
Optimized for decks up to 150 slides.

Resilient to Google API and Notion API edge cases.

Quota-aware (cheap operation, fallback mode when credits nearly depleted).

Minimal setup (easy enough for a non-technical user).

Local-first: reduce GPT dependency except for QA/visual validation.

3. Stretch Goals
(toggleable later, not part of MVP)

Slide transition animations → Notion GIF blocks.

Automatic theme detection (dark vs light).

Wizard-style onboarding UI.

Error reports with actionable tips for end users.
