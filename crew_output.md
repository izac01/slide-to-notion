The provided high-level module structure and corresponding pytest stub code is an outcome that describes how I plan to design my test suite for this project. This includes edge cases, idempotency validation, and coverage of all functions in each module. The tests will ensure the correctness of client handling, hashing function, parsing functionality, and error handling in uploader module, ensuring reliable data migration from Google Slides to Notion.
