{"Implementation approach":"We will use C# as the primary programming language, leveraging the .NET framework for building the Windows application. For task management, we will use an open-source library like 'TaskScheduler' for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks. For code review, we will integrate with 'SharpDiff' library for diff generation and 'Octokit' for GitHub API interaction. The UI will be built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for a clean and intuitive interface.","File list":["Program.cs","TaskManager.cs","CodeReview.cs","NotificationSystem.cs","MainWindow.xaml"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Program {\n        -TaskManager taskManager\n        -CodeReview codeReview\n        -NotificationSystem notificationSystem\n        +Main() void\n    }\n    class TaskManager {\n        -List<Task> tasks\n        +CreateTask(task: Task) void\n        +AssignTask(task: Task, user: User) void\n        +TrackTask(task: Task) TaskStatus\n    }\n    class CodeReview {\n        -List<Code> codes\n        +SubmitCode(code: Code, user: User) void\n        +ReviewCode(code: Code, user: User) void\n    }\n    class NotificationSystem {\n        +SendNotification(user: User, message: string) void\n    }\n    class Task {\n        -string title\n        -User assignee\n        -DateTime deadline\n    }\n    class Code {\n        -string content\n        -User submitter\n    }\n    class User {\n        -string name\n    }\n    Program --> TaskManager\n    Program --> CodeReview\n    Program --> NotificationSystem\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant P as Program\n    participant TM as TaskManager\n    participant CR as CodeReview\n    participant NS as NotificationSystem\n    participant T as Task\n    participant C as Code\n    participant U as User\n    P->>TM: CreateTask(T)\n    TM-->>P: return void\n    P->>TM: AssignTask(T, U)\n    TM-->>P: return void\n    P->>TM: TrackTask(T)\n    TM-->>P: return TaskStatus\n    P->>CR: SubmitCode(C, U)\n    CR-->>P: return void\n    P->>CR: ReviewCode(C, U)\n    CR-->>P: return void\n    P->>NS: SendNotification(U, 'message')\n    NS-->>P: return void\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the level of integration with GitHub for code review. Should the system support direct code submission to GitHub or just provide a diff for manual submission? Also, the type of notifications and their triggers need to be defined."}
