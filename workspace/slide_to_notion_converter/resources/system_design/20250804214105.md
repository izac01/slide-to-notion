## Implementation approach

We will use Python as our main programming language. For the conversion of slides to Notion, we will use the open-source library 'notion-py' for interacting with Notion's API and 'python-pptx' for reading PowerPoint files. For creating a visually appealing UI, we will use 'tkinter'. We will ensure the application environment is pristine and secure by using virtual environments and keeping dependencies to a minimum. We will also document each file and its purpose for better understanding of the codebase.

## File list

- main.py
- converter.py
- ui.py
- file_manager.py
- environment_manager.py

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class Main {
        -Converter converter
        -UI ui
        +main() str
    }
    class Converter {
        -FileManager file_manager
        -EnvironmentManager environment_manager
        +convert(slide_path: str, notion_path: str) str
    }
    class FileManager {
        +read_file(file_path: str) dict
        +write_file(file_path: str, data: dict)
    }
    class EnvironmentManager {
        +setup_environment()
        +cleanup_environment()
    }
    class UI {
        +display_progress(progress: float)
        +display_error(message: str)
    }
    Main --> Converter
    Main --> UI
    Converter --> FileManager
    Converter --> EnvironmentManager


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant C as Converter
    participant FM as FileManager
    participant EM as EnvironmentManager
    participant UI as UI
    M->>C: convert(slide_path, notion_path)
    C->>EM: setup_environment()
    C->>FM: read_file(slide_path)
    FM-->>C: return slide_data
    C->>C: convert slide_data to notion_data
    C->>FM: write_file(notion_path, notion_data)
    C->>EM: cleanup_environment()
    C-->>M: return 'Conversion successful'
    M->>UI: display_progress(1.0)


## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific design and functionality of the 'wizard' mentioned in the original requirements is unclear. Further clarification is needed.
