{"Implementation approach":"We will use Python as our main programming language. For the conversion of slides to Notion, we will use the open-source library 'notion-py' for interacting with Notion's API and 'python-pptx' for reading PowerPoint files. For creating a visually appealing UI, we will use 'tkinter'. We will ensure the application environment is pristine and secure by using virtual environments and keeping dependencies to a minimum. We will also document each file and its purpose for better understanding of the codebase.","File list":["main.py","converter.py","ui.py","file_manager.py","environment_manager.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -Converter converter\n        -UI ui\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class Converter {\n        -FileManager file_manager\n        -EnvironmentManager environment_manager\n        +convert(slide_path: str, notion_path: str) str\n    }\n    class FileManager {\n        +read_file(file_path: str) dict\n        +write_file(file_path: str, data: dict)\n    }\n    class EnvironmentManager {\n        +setup_environment()\n        +cleanup_environment()\n    }\n    class UI {\n        +display_progress(progress: float)\n        +display_error(message: str)\n    }\n    Main --> Converter\n    Main --> UI\n    Converter --> FileManager\n    Converter --> EnvironmentManager\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant C as Converter\n    participant FM as FileManager\n    participant EM as EnvironmentManager\n    participant UI as UI\n    M->>C: convert(slide_path, notion_path)\n    C->>EM: setup_environment()\n    C->>FM: read_file(slide_path)\n    FM-->>C: return slide_data\n    C->>C: convert slide_data to notion_data\n    C->>FM: write_file(notion_path, notion_data)\n    C->>EM: cleanup_environment()\n    C-->>M: return 'Conversion successful'\n    M->>UI: display_progress(1.0)\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specific design and functionality of the 'wizard' mentioned in the original requirements is unclear.
