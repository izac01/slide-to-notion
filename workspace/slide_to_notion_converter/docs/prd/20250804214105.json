{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Continue setting up the code and let me know when its ready for human testing. So make it clear so i can know. C:\\Users\\iZac\\Documents\\slide-to-notion\\. Review these files and document on how everything works. basic summary so i can understand each files purpose. also remove any unneeded files. Id like to really locking down this application so refine it and ensure our env is prestine. of course use descresion with backups. We know our goal is to make this great converter and wizard. Now review all the files here and upgrade as needed. Wizard can wait or you can look at the example deck and guess how id like it to be modularize but keep in mind id sacrafice wizard setup now for a functional and poratble slide to notion 100% great visual converter","Project Name":"slide_to_notion_converter","Product Goals":["Create a robust and efficient slide to Notion converter","Ensure the application environment is pristine and secure","Develop a modular and portable application"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to be able to convert my slides to Notion seamlessly","As a user, I want to understand the purpose of each file in the application","As a user, I want the application to be secure and free from unnecessary files","As a user, I want the application to be portable and functional","As a user, I want the application to have a visually appealing converter"],"Competitive Analysis":["Slide to Notion Converter A: Efficient conversion but lacks visual appeal","Slide to Notion Converter B: Visually appealing but lacks portability","Slide to Notion Converter C: Portable but lacks robustness"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Efficiency and visual appeal of converters\"\n    x-axis \"Low Efficiency\" --> \"High Efficiency\"\n    y-axis \"Low Visual Appeal\" --> \"High Visual Appeal\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Converter A\": [0.7, 0.3]\n    \"Converter B\": [0.5, 0.7]\n    \"Converter C\": [0.6, 0.4]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.9, 0.9]","Requirement Analysis":"The main requirement is to develop a slide to Notion converter that is robust, efficient, visually appealing, and portable. The application environment should be pristine and secure.

It should also display the progress of the conversion process.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specific design and functionality of the 'wizard' mentioned in the original requirements is unclear. Further clarification is needed."}
