## Requirement Analysis

The main requirement is to convert Google Slides to Notion with 1:1 fidelity. This involves parsing the Google Slides, converting it to a format compatible with Notion, and then importing it into Notion. The conversion process should maintain the layout, formatting, and content of the original Google Slides.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Parse Google Slides content']
- ['P0', 'Convert parsed content to Notion-compatible format']
- ['P0', 'Import converted content into Notion']
- ['P1', 'Maintain layout and formatting during conversion']
- ['P1', 'Support batch conversion of multiple Google Slides']

## UI Design draft

A simple and intuitive interface where users can select Google Slides for conversion and view the converted Notion pages. The layout and style should be clean and minimalistic.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific Google Slides and Notion features that need to be supported are unclear. Further clarification is needed to ensure full compatibility.
