{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Continue setting up the code and let me know when its ready for human testing. So make it clear so i can know. C:\\Users\\iZac\\Documents\\slide-to-notion\\workspace is where the files should be so just review in there and use that as the base. i dont need the wheele invented twice. Perfect this code and harden it proacitivly, optimizing means doing the least amount of iterations so if we think hard once and implement we result in optimal behavior over endless pinging and reacting","Project Name":"code_optimization","Product Goals":["Optimize the existing code to reduce iterations","Harden the code to make it robust and error-free","Ensure the code is ready for human testing"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want the code to be optimized so that it runs efficiently","As a user, I want the code to be hardened so that it is robust and error-free","As a user, I want to be notified when the code is ready for testing"],"Competitive Analysis":["Product A: Efficient code but lacks robustness","Product B: Robust code but not optimized for efficiency","Product C: Both efficient and robust but lacks clear communication on readiness for testing"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Efficiency and Robustness of Code\"\n    x-axis \"Low Efficiency\" --> \"High Efficiency\"\n    y-axis \"Low Robustness\" --> \"High Robustness\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Product A\": [0.7, 0.3]\n    \"Product B\": [0.3, 0.7]\n    \"Product C\": [0.6, 0.6]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.8, 0.8]","Requirement Analysis":"The main requirement is to optimize and harden the existing code. The code should be reviewed and improved based on the existing code in the specified directory. The optimized code should result in the least amount of iterations and the hardened code should be robust and error-free. The user should be notified when the code is ready for testing.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Review and understand the existing code"],["P0","Optimize the code to reduce iterations"],["P0","Harden the code to make it robust and error-free"],["P1","Notify the user when the code is ready for testing"],["P2","Ensure the code is located in the specified directory"]],"UI Design draft":"As this is a code optimization project, there is no specific UI design involved. However, clear and concise console outputs or logs can be considered as the 'UI' for this project, which should be designed to provide clear communication on the readiness of the code for testing.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specific areas in the code that need optimization and hardening are not clearly mentioned in the requirements. Further clarification is needed on this."}
