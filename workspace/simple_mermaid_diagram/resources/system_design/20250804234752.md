## Implementation approach

We will use the open-source library 'mermaid' to create a simple diagram showing A leading to B. The diagram will be created using the mermaid syntax and will be kept as simple and concise as possible to meet the user requirements.

## File list

- main.py

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class Main {
        -Diagram diagram
        +main() str
    }
    class Diagram {
        +create_diagram() str
    }
    Main --> Diagram


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant D as Diagram
    M->>D: create_diagram()
    D-->>M: return diagram


## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirements are clear and straightforward.
